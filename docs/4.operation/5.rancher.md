## Rancher

FIWARE Ops team is currently deploying a customised version of
[Rancher 1.6](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v1.6/en/) on top of FIWARE Lab.
This tool allows users with a Cloud account in FIWARE Lab to deploy and
manage a Docker Swarm cluster on FIWARE Lab. Through which they can
deploy their FIWARE applications on the Lab using docker containers.
This is a service offered to the users, and as such FIWARE Lab Node
Administrators do not have much to do. They only need to be sure that:

-   Their OpenStack APIs are reachable from FIWARE Lab servers (which
    should be the default case).

-   Provide the configuration of MTU within their node to users
    interested into using the service (or even installing manually
    Docker Swarm).

For more details, we recommend you to refer to the documentation of the
Rancher set-up within FIWARE Lab:
