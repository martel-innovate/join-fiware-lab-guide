## FI-Health

FI-Health is an end-to-end testing tool that ensures that the OpenStack
integrated components are working as expected. Each of the FIWARE Lab
node is tested in a real-world scenario using OpenStack Rest APIs
provided by the federated Keystone service endpoints. The idea behind
these tests is to provide end-to-end testing of the FIWARE Cloud Portal
to test whether the flow of the application is performing as designed
from start to end. The purpose of carrying out these end-to-end tests
is to identify OpenStack services problems before or at the same time
that the users can observe those problems in the FIWARE Cloud Portal.
Therefore, FI-Health is the key component to provide Quality of Service
in the FIWARE Lab cloud environment.
