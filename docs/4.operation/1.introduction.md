# Operating and Maintaining a FIWARE Lab node

In this section, we include the different tools and procedures that can
be used in order to operate your FIWARE Lab node and try to resolve or
find any possible problem on it. Those tools are used to monitor FIWARE
Lab usage and availability as well as provide statistics and evidences
of FIWARE Lab activities. Last but not least, we introduce the tool that
we use to get the status of the Sprint Planning and Backlog status of
your node.
