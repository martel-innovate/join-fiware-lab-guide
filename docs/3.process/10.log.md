# Registering your Node in Deep Log Inspection

FIWARE Lab offers a centralised solution for Log Inspection to help node
admins detect anomalies in the behaviour of their services or of the
users. The solution is based on ElasticSearch ecosystem. The adoption of
the deep log inspection is optional, but it is highly recommended to
help you in the management of your node.

Node admins will need only to configure a syslog server and configure
OpenStack services to forward their logs to it.

The syslog server used as default solution is the Monasca Log Agent
[https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-monasca_log_api](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-monasca_log_api).
The server can be installed on an existing server (such as the OpenStack
node controllers) or a Virtual Machine provided inside the node.

Detailed instructions are provided in this guide:
[http://deep-log-inspection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/monasca-log-agent/](http://deep-log-inspection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/monasca-log-agent/)

The actual user and password to connect your log agent will be provided
by FIWARE Lab team, you will need to open an issue requesting it in
Jira.
