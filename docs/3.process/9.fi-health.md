## Registering your Node in FI-Health 

Registering a new FIWARE Lab node in the FI-Health tool is a
straightforward operation. You only need to provide the following data:

-   Name of the FIWARE Lab node, which should be the same as that
    provided in the FIWARE Lab Keystone service (see
    [Connecting your Node to FIWARE Lab](8.connecting.md)).

-   Name of the public external network that it is configured in the
    FIWARE Lab node.

-   Name of the shared network.

-   If you have installed Object Storage in order to activate
    those tests.

The best way to proceed with it is creating a FI-Health Issue inside
the GitHub project this can be managed inside the code repository.

Once the FI-Health tool executes the tests for the new FIWARE Lab node,
you can access the application using your admin account credentials. 
These admin account credentials will be created in the 
[Connecting your Node to FIWARE Lab](8.connecting.md) phase and will 
have the format `admin-<name of the FIWARE Lab node>`. This account gives 
you the possibility to relaunch the tests if you need to check if some 
problems was resolved after administrator intervention in the FIWARE Lab 
node.
