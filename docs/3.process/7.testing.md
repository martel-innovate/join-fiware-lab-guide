## Testing FIWARE Lab Node locally 

In order to ensure that the OpenStack instance is installed property, a
set of manual tests are executed by the FIWARE Lab team in order to
guarantee the correct execution of them. Those E2E tests are based on
the historical problems that we found in the FIWARE Lab nodes once it
was up and ready in the past. Some of these problems include no route to
the virtual machine, unable to execute the cloudinit process or unable
to delete properly the allocated resources of a user. Therefore, these
E2E tests cover all the problematic scenarios that arose during the
FIWARE Lab existence.

The tests are divided into Mandatory and Optional. This is because not
all FIWARE Lab nodes implement the Object Storage components and hence
these tests are not required for all nodes. The language that is used to
specify those scenarios is the [Gherkin language](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference). 
Gherkin is plain-text language with well-designed structure to define the 
behaviour of a system. It is designed to the learn and use in a very easy 
way not only by programmers. Besides, it can describe concisely examples 
to describe business rules in most real-world domains. An example of Gherkin 
document is:

Example of Gherkin language

```
Feature: Access to the OpenStack instance
  Scenario: Registering a user into OpenStack
    Given the OpenStack account name of a valid user
      And the valid password of this user
      When the user requests access to the OpenStack instance with those data
      Then the OpenStack account service (Keystone) authenticates the user
      And Keystone redirect to the OpenStack Portal (Horizon).
```

The main keywords In Gherkin are:

-   Feature

-   Scenario

-   Given, When, Then, And, But (Steps)

-   Background

-   Scenario outline

-   Examples

We will take different scenarios in order to complete the lists of tests
that we want to apply for each new FIWARE Lab node. Currently those
tests are executed manually but It does not mean that it will continue
in a manual way, In the future, we will probably adopt a Behaviour
Driven Development solution to automatically execute those tests.

order to be sure that the network interfaces are correctly configured in
both directions. It is comprised of the following scenarios:

```

### Report the results of the execution of the tests

The report consists of a detailed description of the manual tests
provided to the node together with the table of the results of the
execution of those tests. As it is possible that there may be several
errors in different iterative steps, the report will keep the previous
result of the execution of the tests.

Sometimes if the number of errors is very high, we can decide to stop
the execution of the tests and inform to the future FIWARE Lab node that
they have to resolve the current errors in order to follow with the
manual execution of the tests.

Additionally, the results will include some comments about the problem
that was found and in same case, if the reporter knows the solution,
instructions to correct the problem and pass the scenario’s test.
