### Available Resources

#### Physical resources {#physical-resources .ListParagraph}

According to OpenStack documentation the default overcommit for RAM is
1.5:1, the default overcommit for CPU is 16:1 and disk space for the
Virtual Machines should not be overcommitted (please, notice that
Volumes provisioned by Cinder is not physically where the Virtual
machines are) -- That is shown in this page of the documentation:

[*https://docs.openstack.org/arch-design/design-compute/design-compute-overcommit.html*](https://docs.openstack.org/arch-design/design-compute/design-compute-overcommit.html)

The available physical resources can be easily calculated when the
hardware is bought and installed. However, we could ask nova about the
resources (available and used) with a small and simple script like this
one:

```
( nova --timeout 15 --insecure list &gt; /dev/null || exit 1\
  h=$(($(nova --timeout 60 --insecure list --all-tenants | wc -l) - 4))
  echo hosts $h
  for a in `nova --timeout 60 --insecure host-list | awk '/compute/ {print $2}'`; do
    nova --timeout 60 --insecure host-describe $a | awk '
    /total/ {printf ("cpu %s\nmem %s\ndisk %s\n",$6,$8,$10)}\
    /used_now/ {printf ("used_cpu %s\nused_mem %s\nused_disk%s\n",$6,$8,$10)}\
    ' &\
done ) | awk '{sum[$1] += $2 } ; END {for (a in sum) {print a,sum[a]}}'
```

The output for this script is something like this:
```
mem 6767440
used_mem 7213056
disk 512859
used_disk 69913
hosts 1864
cpu 1632
used_cpu 3509
```

Where mem, disk and cpu are the physical resources installed in all the
compute nodes, and `used_mem`, `used_disk` and `used_cpu` are the virtual
resources used. The other field, hosts, is the number of VMs deployed in
the node.

As a caveat, the command `nova host-describe` will perform something
like a Unix `df` command. So, the returned value for disk is the free
space in `/var/lib/nova/instances`. If a NFS share is mounted in several
compute nodes (this would make easier some administrative tasks), the
nova host-describe is going to return the free space in the NFS Share
multiplied for the number of hosts where it is mounted as well as the
`used_disk`. So, the disk information is wrong.

#### Floating IPs

The default external network providing floating IPs, how it was
described in the previous section is named *public-ext-net-01*.

```
neutron net-show public-ext-net-01
```

We will see that the subnet associated with that network has ID
`4430b64a-85d8-4933-ae79-9a76ff1e2aa9`, therefore, querying the subnet:

```
neutron subnet-show 4430b64a-85d8-4933-ae79-9a76ff1e2aa9

…
| allocation_pools | {"start": "130.206.112.16", "end": "130.206.127.254"} |
| cidr | 130.206.112.0/20 |
```

We have a /20 CIDR which is 2^(32-20)=4096 IPs, however, the 1st one is
130.206.112.16 (16 IPs not in the pool from 130.206.112.0 to
130.206.112.15) and the last IP in the pool is 130.206.127.254 (1 IP not
in the pool at the end) - So There are 17 IPs not in the pool, this
means 4096-17=4079 floating IPs. To know how many floating IPs there are
in use, we can check it with Neutron as administrator:

```
neutron floatingip-list | grep “ 130.206” | wc -l
```

### Get summary statistics

In order to get the summary statistics on one node during a period of
time, you can execute the command:

```
$ openstack usage list
```

It will return the list of resources consumed for each tenant/project as
shown below:

```
Usage from 2013-06-25 to 2013-07-24:

  Project   Servers   RAM MB-Hours   CPU Hours   Disk GB-Hours
  --------- --------- -------------- ----------- ---------------
  demo      1         344064.44      672.00      0.00
  stack     3         671626.76      327.94      6558.86
```

### Hosted Users

In order to get the Users, there are several ways of doing this, the way
we usually do is using a script made in Python which retrieves all the
information about users stored in Keystone (groups, users, roles,
role_assignments, etc.) and produces a big json.

Using the Command Line tool *jq*, we query this json file:

```
jq -r '.role_assignments[] |
       select (.role.id == "&lt;role_id basic, trial or community") |
       .user.id' &lt;fichero_json_usuarios&gt; | wc -l
```
