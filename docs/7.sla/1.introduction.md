# Service Level Agreement

In this section, we describe the Service Level Agreement (SLA) offered by the
FIWARE Lab nodes, how we can calculate the SLA values as well as the definition
of the procedure to notify FIWARE Lab node administrators about a SLA breach and
after a reiterative breach in the SLA, the notification of discontinued from the 
FIWARE Lab. 

The SLA have been defined in a measurable way and based on measurable threshold 
to make the SLA breach detection as objective as possible.
