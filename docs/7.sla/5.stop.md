## Procedure to stop a FIWARE Lab node due to SLA failures

If during a month (as defined above) SLA breach has been detected for a
node. The FIWARE Lab Management team will proceed as follows:

1.  Inform the node about the SLA breach detection and ask for clarification 
    about the SLA breach.

2.  If clarifications on SLA breaches are not satisfactory and node is
    not back to normal operations in 30 days (i.e. SLA is violated twice
    in a row), the node will be notified about the decision of
    disconnecting it from FIWARE Lab.

3.  If clarifications on SLA breaches are satisfactory and node is back
    to normal operations in 30 days, no other action will be taken.
