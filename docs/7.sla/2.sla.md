## Definition of the SLA

The FIWARE Lab nodes have to assure a certain level of quality defined 
through a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Nevertheless, the downtime of 
cloud computing relative to SLAs is very difficult to calculate as the 
root cause of this service interruption involves an evaluation of a 
complex environment. This is the reason why SLAs focus on the overall 
service provided by a node, including the response time to resolve issues 
reported from FIWARE Lab users. Therefore, the FIWARE Lab SLAs defined 
for each FIWARE Lab node are:

-   Services availability on the node above 95% threshold.

-   Level 1 and Level 2 support, Monday to Friday, 9 am to 5 pm CET.

-   Help-Desk tickets response time before EoB of the following working 
    day for 95% of them.

-   Help-Desk tickets resolution time within 2 working days (EoB of the 
    second one) for 95% of them. Tickets transferred and accepted by 
    level 3 (FIWARE Lab nodes teams) support as tickets that will 
    require a software patch or workaround to be developed by the them
    will be considered resolved at level 1 and 2 support levels.

Failures to meet the above SLAs, may lead, if not promptly fixed, to the 
termination of the rights of the node to use the FIWARE brand and its 
disconnection from the FIWARE Lab federation.
