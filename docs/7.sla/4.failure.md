## Procedure to inform failure in SLA

Every month the FIWARE Lab Management team compute the SLAs for the last
period. According to the computed SLA the management team will contact
nodes that failed their SLA and notify them about the violation and 
potential implications. The notification includes the violated SLAs and 
associated values as computed by the FIWARE Lab Management team. The 
month time frame has been selected to avoid that one single maintenance 
day at the beginning of the monitoring, influence too negatively the SLA 
computation.

Once notified, nodes have *one week* time to check the claims from the
FIWARE Lab Management team, and proof that the SLA failure notification
is not justified (e.g. the failure was due to central keystone
malfunctioning, or the failure was due to network issues of the
monitoring services, â€¦).

The SLA is computed through the monitoring services availability and the
Help-Desk tickets handling, as defined below.
