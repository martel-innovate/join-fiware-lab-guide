# Management operations on a FIWARE Lab node

In this section, we include the different management operations that
are needed in order to work with the FIWARE Lab node. These operations
include the management of new FIWARE Lab accounts, the procedure to
create base images taking into account the security recommendations and
the management of the Help Desk tickets associated to the different FIWARE
Lab nodes.

## Account Management

This section contains the different actions to manage a user account.
The most important issue relating to customer accounts is the process to
upgrade from a FIWARE Trial Account to a FIWARE Community Account, what
are their available resources, how can they apply and what every FIWARE Lab node
administrator have to do to proceed with it.

### Request for Community Account Upgrade

To request an account upgrade, FIWARE Lab users need to request it through the
filling in of an Upgrade Account form available in the
[FIWARE Lab cloud portal](https://cloud.lab.fiware.org).

-   *Who can apply?*

    Individuals and Companies willing to develop innovative applications
    based on FIWARE, and to disclose the usage of FIWARE they will make.

-   *How much does it cost*?

    It's free! We are enacting this requirement to ensure that start-ups
    and SMEs willing to develop applications and demonstrators using
    FIWARE have the access to the proper resources.

-   *How long do I retain the Community Status*?

    The typical duration for the community status is 9 months. We believe
    this is enough to allow teams the development of a complete solution based
    on FIWARE. If it is needed, accounts can be extended. Send a request to
    [fiware-lab-help@lists.fiware.org](mailto:fiware-lab-help@lists.fiware.org)
    in order to request an extension of your account with the justification of
    this extension.

-   *How can I request a Community Account upgrade?*

    Users can apply through the [FIWARE Lab cloud page](https://cloud.lab.fiware.org/)
    clicking on the “Request Community Account” button.

-   *How long should it take to complete the procedure?*

    The support team is available 9 am to 5 pm during working days. Except
    for complex request where negotiation of resources is required, a
    request should be fulfilled in 1 working day.

### Quotas and Flavours

#### What is a Flavour and what are the available flavours?

Flavours represents the size of virtual machines. FIWARE Lab flavours
are based on OpenStack flavours. Available flavours in the FIWARE Lab
are listed in this table.

| **ID** | **Flavour** | **Memory** | **Disk** | **Virtual CPUs** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | m1.tiny | 512 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | m1.small | 2048 | 20 | 1 |
| 3 | m1.medium | 4096 | 40 | 2 |
| 4 | m1.large | 8192 | 80 | 4 |

Keep in mind that it is only a recommendation to optimize the physical
resources available in a node. Each of the FIWARE Lab administrators is
free to create new flavours or change resources assigned to users but in
that case, they could break the homogeneity between different FIWARE Lab
nodes and could be difficult (if not impossible in some cases) to make a
migration from one node to another.

#### What are the default quotas?

By default, each user has assigned a minimum number of resources that
can be used in the development of its solution. This quota is comprised
of the following values:

| **VM Instances** | **vCPUs** | **Hard Disk** | **Memory** | **Public IPs** |    **Routers** | **Networks** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 2 | 40 Gb | 4096 Mb | 1 | 0 | 0 |

#### What are the default maximum quotas?

If the project required more resources, the users have the possibility
to explain it and the default quotas can be extended to a maximum
default quotas that is comprised of the following values:

| **VM Instances** | **vCPUs** | **Hard Disk** | **Memory** | **Public IPs** |    **Routers** | **Networks** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5  | 10 | 100 Gb | 10240 Mb | 1 | 1 | 1 |

Keep in mind that in order that users can obtain more resources, it is
mandatory that they provide the corresponding justification why they
need more resources. Exceptionally, if users need more resources, after
a clear justification the FIWARE Lab nodes can provide extra resources
to cover them.

### Resource assignment and account upgrade by FIWARE Lab administrators

This section describes how FIWARE Lab Node operators should process
incoming requests. The process is simple and depicted below.

![Account upgrade workflow](image15.png)

The FIWARE Lab administrators start processing the account
upgrade when they receive the corresponding ticket. Each
comment will be notified to the end-user that will be able
to provide you further information in this way. For resource
assignment/negotiation the guide in Section [Quotas and Flavours](#Quotas_and_Flavours)
will be considered.

If your FIWARE Lab node is not able to complete the assignment,
we suggest that FIWARE Lab administrators makes a negotiation
with other FIWARE Lab nodes in order to transfer the request and
assign the resources in any other FIWARE Lab node. Of course,
you should inform users about this migration assignment to confirm
that it is ok for them.

#### How to assign resources to a new community user

To manage user information, you have to use the Horizon-based Cloud
Portal interface at
[*https://cloud.lab.fiware.org*](https://cloud.lab.fiware.org). In this
web site, you can to click on the button *Request Community Account* and
you will see a google form requesting the information required to set up
a community account. Once the user has filled in all the information and
submitted it, the process will start with the creation of the
corresponding Jira ticket. The next steps that every FIWARE Lab administrator
has to follow are the following:

1.  Start progressing the ticket as soon as you receive it.

2.  Check the requested resources and comment to inform the user about
decision on resources, or additional information you need.

3.  If the user is not created you have to create it.

4.  If the user has not been granted access to any of the projects to
create cloud resources, you have to create it and assign the user as a member
of the project.

5.  Assign the role *Community* in the domain *default* to the user. The
user can have several roles for different projects (owner, member,
...), however, it is a Community or a Trial user for the
whole domain.

6.  Include in the metadata of the user (*description* field) the date
in which the user has been upgraded to Community (with the format
`"community_started_at": "YYYY-MM-DD"`) and the duration of this community
account expressed in days (with the format `"community_duration": "DD"`).

7.  Assign the desired quotas in your FIWARE Lab node to the user.

8.  Assign the endpoint group of your FIWARE Lab node to the user’s project.

9.  If you need to contact the user you can use the email address
included in the user detail.

10. Progress to “done” when completed.

11. Alternatively, if any impediment arises, move to impeded, and inform
the user by commenting the ticket.

### Procedure to create new FIWARE Lab user account

The process to create a new FIWARE Lab user account, includes a
procedure to check that the email introduced is a valid email. During
this process, FIWARE requests several information to the user to be filled in a
google form. This information includes:

-   User name to be kept in the database.

-   User email to communicate any issue directly to the user.

-   Preferred FIWARE Lab node to be used.

-   Acceptance of the FIWARE Lab Terms & Conditions.

![FIWARE Lab user creation form](image16.png)

All these data are mandatory to be fulfilled. This form activates a
specific procedure to manage the creation of the FIWARE Lab user
account.

![FIWARE Lab user creation workflow](image17.png)

Once that the user submits this information an email will automatically
be sent to the user using the email provided. This email includes in the
subject (Betreff in German in the following picture) the confirmation
code to be submitted. The user must reply to this email in order to
confirm that the email is correct.

![FIWARE Lab user creation, confirmation email template.](image18.png)

During this procedure, the reception of the confirmation email is mandatory in
order to create the new user account.
to create a new user. This confirmation is obtained through the response
of this received email leaving intact the email's subject. The received response
email, with the subject intact, is enough to validate the user's email and
activate the JIRA ticket creation with the corresponding FIWARE Lab
node administrator in order to create the corresponding user account.
After the creation, the FIWARE Lab node administrator informs the users
that the new account has been created and the recommendation to change
the password by themselves.

The information of the user created (and eventually deleted) will be
kept under Data Protection control for statistical purposes and
evaluation of the creation and deletion of user accounts in the FIWARE
Lab ecosystem.
