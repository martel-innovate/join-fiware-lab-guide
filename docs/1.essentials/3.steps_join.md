## Steps to become a New FIWARE Lab node

In order to actually become a new FIWARE Lab node, several activities
are required from both the Node and FIWARE Lab admins. The first is the
signature of a Letter of Intent in order to communicate to the node
these steps, the SLA levels that they have to fulfil and the FIWARE Lab
user data ownership and legislation to be applied in terms of Data
Protection. Additionally, it is explained that the non-fulfilment of the
SLA will produce a disconnection of the node from the FIWARE Lab. The
Annex D: Letter of intent to become a new FIWARE Lab node contains the
template of this Letter of Intent.

The table below describes, step by step, the whole procedure as it is at
the time of writing this document.

Some steps may change in the near future due to the R6.4 of FIWARE
Keyrock that includes the migration from Keyrock to Keystone and the
Federation of OpenStack Keystone instances, therefore in short time all
the nodes can use their own OpenStack Keystone instance and create users
on the FIWARE Lab node.
