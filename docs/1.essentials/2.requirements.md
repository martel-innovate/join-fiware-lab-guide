## Requirements

The hardware requirements are associated with the number of end-users
(community users) that can be maintained in the node. The minimum number
of those customers have to be 20. Based on this, the hardware and
networks requirements are specified in the following sections.

### Hardware Requirements

The hardware requirements are associated with the number of end-users
(community users) is the following:

-   Up to 10 vCores per end-user.

-   Up to 20 Gb RAM per customer.

-   Up to 150 Gb Hard Drive per customer.

-   At least 22 Gb for images management.

### Network Requirements

The connectivity capacity will be used for two aims: connect to the
backbone of the FIWARE Lab to support node management operations, and
provide connectivity to deployed services for end-users. You have also
to provide a pool of public IPs that can be used during the OpenStack
deployment (in order to expose the public API) and at a later time by
the FIWARE Lab end-users.

Networking requirements:

-   1 Gbps connectivity for the backbone;

-   100 Mbps Internet connectivity for end-users;

-   Firewall to ensure security;

-   At least 1 public IPv4 available for each end-user (20 public IPs
    for 20 community users) plus public IPs for the different
    OpenStack services.

-   IPv6 support is desirable although not required.
