# Steps to discontinue a FIWARE Lab node

In order to discontinue the operation of a running FIWARE Lab node there
are several activities and obligations to be respected. The most
important, which is the base of the FIWARE philosophy, is taking care of
the migration of the resources toward a persistent node, in order to
avoid service outage.

The table below describes all steps, as they are now at the time of
writing this document.

Some steps may change in the near future due to the R6.4 of FIWARE
Keyrock that includes the migration from Keyrock to Keystone and the
Federation of OpenStack Keystone instances, therefore in short time all
the nodes can use their own OpenStack Keystone instance and create use
on the FIWARE Lab node.
