## Steps to discontinue a FIWARE Lab node

In order to discontinue the operation of a running FIWARE Lab node there
are several activities and obligations to be respected. The most
important, which is the base of the FIWARE philosophy, is taking care of
the migration of users toward a persistent node, in order to
avoid service outage.
